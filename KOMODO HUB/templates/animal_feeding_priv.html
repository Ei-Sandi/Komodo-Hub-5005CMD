        <h1>Feeding Baby Animals with IAR</h1>
        <p>On September 16th, weâ€™ll be helping to feed and take care of endangered baby animals, including orphaned Sumatran orangutans. 
            Komodo Hub is working in collaboration with IAR Indonesia Foundation- a committed animal preservation group working to protect 
            native species. Many of these animals have been rescued from destroyed habitats so proper feeding is crucial to their rehabilitation. 
            Volunteers will aid in preparing special diets, including fresh fruits and milk formulas tailored to each species. Necessary training 
            and instructions will be provided on site on the day of the feeding as well as feeding equipment.
