        <h1>Beach Clean Up in Pelabuhanratu</h1>
        <p>On June 22nd, our team of volunteers will be collecting litter to help protect the habitat of endangered animals.
            Beaches are often littered with items such as plastic bottles, fishing nets and other debris that can pose a serious
            threat to wildlife that ingest or get stuck in these items. By clearing Indonesiaâ€™s beaches of this waste, we can make 
            a direct improvement on the ecosystem and its inhabitants. To support our helpers, all necessary equipment including 
            gloves, bin bags and grabbers are provided by Komodo Hub.
